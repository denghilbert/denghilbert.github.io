Write the response in JSONL format with {ARXIVID, COMMENT, RELEVANCE, NOVELTY} on each line, one for each paper.
The ARXIVID should be the ArXiv ID.
The COMMENT should identify whether there is a criteria that match the paper very closely. If so, it should mention it by number (no need to mention the non-matching criteria).
These matches should not be based on general terms like "language modeling" or "advancements" and should specifically refer to a criterion.
The RELEVANCE should be a relevance score from 1-10 where 10 must be directly related to the exact, specific criterion with near-synonym keyword matches and authors who are known for working on the topic, 1 is irrelevant to any criterion, and unrelated to your friend's general interest area, 3 is papers that are relevant to the general interest area, but not specific criteria, and 5 is a direct match to a specific criterion.
The NOVELTY should be a score from 1 to 10, where 10 is a groundbreaking, general-purpose discovery that would transform the entire field and 1 is work that improves one aspect of a problem or is an application to a very specific field. Read the abstract carefully to determine this and assume that authors cannot be trusted in their claims of novelty.
