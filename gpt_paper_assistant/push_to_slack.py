Crucially, standard diffusion models rely on the well-established theory of score matching, but efforts to generalize this to discrete structures have not yielded the same empirical gains. In this work, we bridge this gap by proposing score entropy, a novel discrete score matching loss that is more stable than existing methods, forms an ELBO for maximum likelihood training, and can be efficiently optimized with a denoising variant. We scale our Score Entropy Discrete Diffusion models (SEDD) to the experimental setting of GPT-2, achieving highly competitive likelihoods while also introducing distinct algorithmic advantages. In particular, when comparing similarly sized SEDD and GPT-2 models, SEDD attains comparable perplexities (normally within $+10\\%$ of and sometimes outperforming the baseline). Furthermore, SEDD models learn a more faithful sequence distribution (around $4\\times$ better compared to GPT-2 models with ancestral sampling as measured by large models), can trade off compute for generation quality (needing only $16\\times$ fewer network evaluations to match GPT-2), and enables arbitrary infilling beyond the standard left to right prompting.", "year": 2023, "authors": [{"authorId": "2261494043", "name": "Aaron Lou"}, {"authorId": "83262128", "name": "Chenlin Meng"}, {"authorId": "2490652", "name": "Stefano Ermon"}], "ARXIVID": "2310.16834", "COMMENT": "The paper shows a significant advance in the performance of diffusion language models, directly meeting one of the criteria.", "RELEVANCE": 10, "NOVELTY": 8}, "2310.16779": {"paperId": "edc8953d559560d3237fc0b27175cdb1114c0ca5", "externalIds": {"ArXiv": "2310.16779", "CorpusId": 264451949}, "title": "Multi-scale Diffusion Denoised Smoothing", "abstract": "Along with recent diffusion models, randomized smoothing has become one of a few tangible approaches that offers adversarial robustness to models at scale, e.g., those of large pre-trained models.

In this paper, we investigate the trade-off between accuracy and certified robustness of denoised smoothing: for example, we question on which representation of diffusion model would maximize the certified robustness of denoised smoothing. We consider a new objective that aims collective robustness of smoothed classifiers across multiple noise levels at a shared diffusion model, which also suggests a new way to compensate the cost of accuracy in randomized smoothing for its certified robustness. This objective motivates us to fine-tune diffusion model (a) to perform consistent denoising whenever the original image is recoverable, but (b) to generate rather diverse outputs otherwise.
